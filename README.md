A joke sorting algorithm called Gulag sort, in which every non-ordered item is moved into a separate list called a 'gulag', leaving only a sorted list. This is repeated on the unsorted Gulag elements until multiple ordered lists are left. 
These lists are merged together to get a final, sorted list
